## 📚 Chapter 1: Understanding Fractions

### What IS a Fraction?
A fraction represents **part of a whole**. Think of it like slicing a pizza! 🍕

\`\`\`
Numerator (Top) → How many slices you have
─────────────────
Denominator (Bottom) → Total slices in the pizza
\`\`\`

**Example:** 3/4 means you have **3 slices** out of a pizza cut into **4 equal parts**.

### Visual Representation
\`\`\`
Full Pizza:    🍕🍕🍕🍕 (4 slices)
3/4 Pizza:     🍕🍕🍕□ (3 slices eaten, 1 left)
1/2 Pizza:     🍕🍕□□ (2 slices left)
1/4 Pizza:     🍕□□□ (only 1 slice!)
\`\`\`

### 🎮 Quick Check
**Which is MORE pizza?**
- A) 3/8 of a pizza
- B) 5/8 of a pizza
- C) 1/8 of a pizza

<details>
<summary>💡 Show Answer</summary>

**B) 5/8** - More slices = more pizza! When denominators are the same, just compare the numerators.
</details>

---

## 📚 Chapter 2: Types of Fractions

### 🟢 Proper Fractions (Less than 1)
The numerator is **smaller** than the denominator.
> Examples: 1/2, 3/4, 7/10

Think: "I have less than one whole pizza"

### 🔴 Improper Fractions (Greater than or equal to 1)
The numerator is **equal to or larger** than the denominator.
> Examples: 5/4, 7/3, 9/9

Think: "I have more than one pizza!"

### 🟡 Mixed Numbers
A whole number plus a proper fraction.
> Examples: 1½, 2¾, 3⅖

Think: "I have 2 whole pizzas AND 3 extra slices"

### 🔄 Converting Between Them

**Improper → Mixed:**
\`\`\`
Example: 11/4 = ? 

Step 1: Divide 11 ÷ 4 = 2 remainder 3
Step 2: Whole number = 2, Remainder = 3, Denominator stays = 4
Answer: 2¾
\`\`\`

**Mixed → Improper:**
\`\`\`
Example: 3⅖ = ?

Step 1: Multiply whole number by denominator: 3 × 5 = 15
Step 2: Add the numerator: 15 + 2 = 17
Step 3: Keep the denominator: 5
Answer: 17/5
\`\`\`

### 🎮 Practice Challenge
**Convert 13/5 to a mixed number**

<details>
<summary>💡 Show Answer</summary>

13 ÷ 5 = 2 remainder 3
**Answer: 2⅗**
</details>

---

## 📚 Chapter 3: Equivalent Fractions

Different fractions can represent the **same amount**!

### The Rule
**Multiply or divide BOTH the top and bottom by the SAME number.**

\`\`\`
1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8 = 5/10

All of these are 50% - exactly half!
\`\`\`

### Visual Proof
\`\`\`
1/2:   [████████░░░░░░░░] Half is shaded
2/4:   [████░░░░|████░░░░] Same amount shaded!
4/8:   [██░░|██░░|██░░|██░░] Still the same!
\`\`\`

### 🎮 Spot the Fake!
Which of these is NOT equal to 2/3?
- A) 4/6
- B) 6/9
- C) 8/15
- D) 10/15

<details>
<summary>💡 Show Answer</summary>

**C) 8/15** - If you multiply 2×4 and 3×4, you get 8/12, not 8/15!
The pattern is: 2/3 = 4/6 = 6/9 = 8/12 = 10/15 ✅
</details>

---

## 📚 Chapter 4: Simplifying Fractions

**Goal:** Make the fraction as simple as possible!

### The Method
**Divide both numerator and denominator by their Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**

\`\`\`
Example: Simplify 12/16

Step 1: Find factors
  12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
  16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
  
Step 2: Find GCF = 4

Step 3: Divide both by 4
  12 ÷ 4 = 3
  16 ÷ 4 = 4
  
Answer: 3/4 ✨
\`\`\`

### 🎯 Pro Tip
Look for obvious factors first:
- Both even? → Divide by 2
- Both end in 5 or 0? → Divide by 5
- Both divisible by 3? → Divide by 3

---

## 📚 Chapter 5: Adding & Subtracting Fractions

### 🔑 Golden Rule
**You MUST have the same denominator (bottom number)!**

### Same Denominator? Easy!
\`\`\`
Example: 3/7 + 2/7

Just add the tops: 3 + 2 = 5
Keep the bottom: 7
Answer: 5/7 🎉
\`\`\`

### Different Denominators? Find the LCM!
\`\`\`
Example: 1/3 + 1/4

Step 1: Find LCM of 3 and 4
  Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15...
  Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16...
  LCM = 12 ✅

Step 2: Convert both fractions
  1/3 = 1×4/3×4 = 4/12
  1/4 = 1×3/4×3 = 3/12

Step 3: Add!
  4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12 ✨
\`\`\`

### Real-World Example 🌍
**Pizza Party Problem:**
- Sarah ate 1/3 of a pizza
- Tom ate 1/4 of the SAME pizza
- How much did they eat together?

1/3 + 1/4 = 4/12 + 3/12 = **7/12** of the pizza! 🍕

---

## 📚 Chapter 6: Multiplying Fractions

### The EASIEST Operation!
**Just multiply across: tops × tops, bottoms × bottoms**

\`\`\`
Example: 2/3 × 4/5

Numerator: 2 × 4 = 8
Denominator: 3 × 5 = 15

Answer: 8/15 ✨
\`\`\`

### Shortcut: Cancel First!
\`\`\`
Example: 3/4 × 2/3

Notice: 3 on top cancels with 3 on bottom!

3̶/4 × 2/3̶ → 1/4 × 2/1 = 2/4 = 1/2
\`\`\`

### What Does It Mean?
"Half of a half" = 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4 (a quarter!)

\`\`\`
Start:  [████████████████] (whole)
Half:   [████████░░░░░░░░] 
Half of that: [████░░░░░░░░░░░░] (quarter!)
\`\`\`

---

## 📚 Chapter 7: Dividing Fractions

### The KCF Rule 🎯
**Keep, Change, Flip**

\`\`\`
Example: 1/2 ÷ 1/4

Step 1: KEEP the first fraction → 1/2
Step 2: CHANGE ÷ to × → ×
Step 3: FLIP the second fraction → 4/1

New problem: 1/2 × 4/1 = 4/2 = 2 ✨
\`\`\`

### Why Does This Work?
Dividing by 1/4 means "how many quarters fit in this?"
- How many 1/4s fit in 1/2?
- Answer: **2** quarter slices fit in a half! 🍕

A recipe calls for 2¾ cups of flour. You want to make half the recipe. How much flour do you need?

<details>
<summary>💡 Show Solution</summary>

Step 1: Convert to improper fraction
  2¾ = (2×4+3)/4 = 11/4

Step 2: Find half (multiply by 1/2)
  11/4 × 1/2 = 11/8

Step 3: Convert back to mixed number
  11÷8 = 1 remainder 3
  **Answer: 1⅜ cups of flour** ✅
</details>

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

## Learning Objectives
    - Calculate percentages of amounts
    - Find percentage increases and decreases
    - Solve reverse percentage problems
    - Apply percentages in financial contexts

## Key Concepts

### Finding a Percentage of an Amount
Method 1: Convert to decimal
15 % of £240 = 0.15 × £240 = £36

Method 2: Use fractions
15 % of £240 = 15 / 100 × £240 = £36

### Percentage Increase and Decrease
    ** Percentage Increase:** New Value = Original × (100 + increase %) / 100
    ** Percentage Decrease:** New Value = Original × (100 - decrease %) / 100

    ** Example 1:** A £200 item increases by 15 %
    New price = £200 × 115 / 100 = £200 × 1.15 = £230

    ** Example 2:** A £80 jacket is reduced by 25 %
    Sale price = £80 × 75 / 100 = £80 × 0.75 = £60

### Reverse Percentages
If you know the final amount after a percentage change, work backwards:

** Example:** After a 20 % increase, a price is £144. Find original price.
Let original price = x
x × 1.2 = £144
x = £144 ÷ 1.2 = £120

### Compound Interest
A = P(1 + r / 100) ^ t
Where: A = final amount, P = principal, r = rate %, t = time

    ** Example:** £1000 invested at 5 % compound interest for 3 years
A = 1000(1.05)³ = 1000 × 1.157625 = £1157.63

## Real - World Applications
- VAT calculations (20 % in UK)
  - Salary increases and tax calculations
    - Discount calculations in shopping
      - Interest rates and investments
        - Statistics and data analysis

## Practice Problems
1. Find 35 % of £180
2. A £50 item is reduced by 30 %.What's the new price?
3. After a 25 % increase, a salary is £37, 500. What was the original salary ?
  4. Calculate compound interest: £500 at 4 % for 2 years
5. A shop adds 20 % VAT to all prices.If the final price is £96, what was the pre - VAT price ? `,

## Learning Objectives
  - Convert numbers to and from standard form
    - Perform calculations with numbers in standard form
      - Apply standard form to scientific contexts

## Key Concepts

Standard form expresses numbers as A × 10 ^ n, where 1 ≤ A < 10 and n is an integer.

### Converting to Standard Form

  ** Large Numbers:**
    345,000 = 3.45 × 10 ^ 5
      (Move decimal 5 places left, so power is + 5)

      ** Small Numbers:**
        0.0078 = 7.8 × 10 ^ -3
          (Move decimal 3 places right, so power is - 3)

### Converting from Standard Form
4.7 × 10 ^ 6 = 4, 700,000
2.3 × 10 ^ -4 = 0.00023

### Calculations with Standard Form

  ** Multiplication:**
    (2.5 × 10 ^ 4) × (3 × 10 ^ 2) = (2.5 × 3) × 10 ^ (4 + 2) = 7.5 × 10 ^ 6

      ** Division:**
        (8 × 10 ^ 6) ÷ (4 × 10 ^ 3) = (8 ÷ 4) × 10 ^ (6 - 3) = 2 × 10 ^ 3

          ** Addition / Subtraction:**
            Convert to same power of 10 first:
3.2 × 10 ^ 5 + 4.7 × 10 ^ 4 = 3.2 × 10 ^ 5 + 0.47 × 10 ^ 5 = 3.67 × 10 ^ 5

## Scientific Applications
  - Astronomical distances(light years, AU)
    - Atomic measurements(mass, size)
      - Population statistics
        - Financial calculations(national debt, GDP)

## Practice Problems
1. Write 5, 280,000 in standard form

## Learning Objectives
  - Solve linear equations with one unknown
    - Rearrange formulae to change the subject
      - Solve equations with brackets and fractions
        - Apply algebraic skills to real - world problems

## Key Concepts

### Basic Linear Equations
An equation where the highest power of the variable is 1.

  ** Example 1:** Solve 3x + 7 = 22
    - Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15
      - Divide by 3: x = 5
        - Check: 3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22 ✓

** Example 2:** Solve 5x - 8 = 2x + 10
  - Subtract 2x from both sides: 3x - 8 = 10
    - Add 8 to both sides: 3x = 18
      - Divide by 3: x = 6

### Equations with Brackets
Expand brackets first, then solve.

** Example:** Solve 2(x + 3) = 14
  - Expand: 2x + 6 = 14
    - Subtract 6: 2x = 8
      - Divide by 2: x = 4

        ** Example:** Solve 3(2x - 1) = 4(x + 2)
          - Expand: 6x - 3 = 4x + 8
            - Subtract 4x: 2x - 3 = 8
              - Add 3: 2x = 11
                - Divide by 2: x = 5.5

### Equations with Fractions
Multiply through by the denominator to clear fractions.

** Example:** Solve(x + 2) / 3 = 5
  - Multiply by 3: x + 2 = 15
    - Subtract 2: x = 13

      ** Example:** Solve x / 4 + x / 6 = 5
        - Find common denominator(12): 3x / 12 + 2x / 12 = 5
          - Simplify: 5x / 12 = 5
            - Multiply by 12: 5x = 60
              - Divide by 5: x = 12

### Rearranging Formulae
Change the subject by performing inverse operations.

** Example 1:** Make x the subject of y = 3x + 2
  - Subtract 2: y - 2 = 3x
    - Divide by 3: x = (y - 2) / 3

      ** Example 2:** Make r the subject of A = πr²
- Divide by π: A / π = r²
- Square root: r = √(A / π)

## Real - World Applications
  - Distance, speed, time problems
    - Financial calculations(loans, investments)
      - Engineering and construction
        - Scientific formulae

## Learning Objectives
  - Solve quadratic equations by factoring
    - Use the quadratic formula
      - Complete the square
        - Interpret solutions graphically

## Key Concepts

### Standard Form
A quadratic equation has the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0.

### Factoring Method
  ** Example 1:** Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0
    - Factor: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
      - Solutions: x = -2 or x = -3

        ** Example 2:** Solve x² - 7x + 12 = 0
          - Factor: (x - 3)(x - 4) = 0
            - Solutions: x = 3 or x = 4

### Quadratic Formula
For ax² + bx + c = 0:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

  ** Example:** Solve 2x² + 3x - 2 = 0
    - a = 2, b = 3, c = -2
      - x = (-3 ± √(9 + 16)) / 4 = (-3 ± 5) / 4
        - x = 1 / 2 or x = -2

### Completing the Square
  ** Example:** Solve x² + 6x + 5 = 0
    - Rearrange: x² + 6x = -5
      - Complete square: (x + 3)² - 9 = -5
        - Simplify: (x + 3)² = 4
          - Solutions: x + 3 = ±2, so x = -1 or x = -5

### The Discriminant
b² - 4ac tells us about the nature of roots:
- If > 0: two real roots
  - If = 0: one repeated root
    - If < 0: no real roots

## Real - World Applications
  - Projectile motion
    - Area and optimization problems
      - Business profit / loss calculations
        - Engineering design

## Practice Problems

## Learning Objectives
  - Calculate mean, median, mode, and range
    - Interpret frequency tables and grouped data
      - Create and interpret charts and graphs
        - Compare data sets using statistics

## Key Concepts

### Measures of Central Tendency

  ** Mean(Average):**
    Sum of all values ÷ number of values

Example: 2, 5, 7, 8, 3
Mean = (2 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 3) ÷ 5 = 25 ÷ 5 = 5

  ** Median(Middle Value):**
    Arrange in order, find middle value
Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 → Median = 5

For even number of values, take mean of middle two:
2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 → Median = (5 + 7) ÷ 2 = 6

  ** Mode(Most Common):**
    The value that appears most frequently
Example: 2, 3, 3, 5, 7 → Mode = 3

### Measures of Spread

  ** Range:**
    Highest value - Lowest value
Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 → Range = 8 - 2 = 6

### Frequency Tables
  | Score | Frequency |
| -------| -----------|
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 5 |
| 3 | 7 |
| 4 | 2 |

  Mean = (1×3 + 2×5 + 3×7 + 4×2) ÷ (3 + 5 + 7 + 2) = 43 ÷ 17 = 2.53

### Grouped Data
For grouped data, use midpoint of each class:

| Height(cm) | Frequency | Midpoint |
| -------------| -----------| ----------|
| 150 - 159 | 5 | 154.5 |
| 160 - 169 | 8 | 164.5 |
| 170 - 179 | 3 | 174.5 |

  Estimated mean = (154.5×5 + 164.5×8 + 174.5×3) ÷ 16

### Charts and Graphs
  - Bar charts: for categorical data
    - Histograms: for continuous data
      - Pie charts: for showing proportions
        - Scatter graphs: for showing correlation

## Practice Problems
1. Find mean, median, mode, and range: 4, 7, 2, 9, 5, 7, 3
2. From a frequency table showing test scores, calculate the mean
3. Interpret a histogram showing heights of students
4. Create a pie chart for favorite subjects survey data`,

## Learning Objectives
- Understand place value in whole numbers and decimals
- Order numbers from smallest to largest
- Round numbers to given places
- Use place value in real-world contexts

## Place Value Chart
| Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Units | . | Tenths | Hundredths | Thousandths |
|-----------|----------|------|-------|---|--------|------------|-------------|
| 3         | 4        | 2    | 7     | . | 5      | 8          | 6           |

Value of digit 4 is 400 (4 Hundreds).
Value of digit 8 is 0.08 (8 Hundredths).

## Ordering Numbers
When comparing numbers:
1. Compare the digits in the largest place value column first.
2. If they are the same, move to the next column to the right.
3. Continue until you find a difference.

**Example:** Compare 3.42 and 3.45
- Units: Both 3 (Same)
- Tenths: Both 4 (Same)
- Hundredths: 2 vs 5 (5 is bigger)
So, 3.45 > 3.42

## Rounding Numbers
**Rule:** Look at the digit to the right of the place you are rounding to.
- If it's 5 or more, round UP (add 1 to the rounding digit).
- If it's 4 or less, stay DOWN (keep the rounding digit same).

**Example:** Round 45.67 to 1 decimal place.
- Digit at 1st decimal place is 6.
- Digit to the right is 7 (5 or more).
- Round up 6 to 7.
- Answer: 45.7

**Example:** Round 342 to the nearest 10.
- Digit at tens place is 4.
- Digit to the right is 2 (4 or less).
- Keep 4, replace 2 with 0.
- Answer: 340

## Applications
- Money: £12.50 is 1 ten, 2 units, 5 tenths, 0 hundredths.
- Measurement: 1.5m vs 1.45m.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what fractions represent
- Compare and order fractions
- Add and subtract simple fractions
- Convert between fractions and decimals

## What are Fractions?

A fraction represents part of a whole:
- **Numerator** (top number): how many parts we have
- **Denominator** (bottom number): how many equal parts in total

Examples:
- 3/4 means 3 out of 4 equal parts
- 1/2 means 1 out of 2 equal parts (half)
- 5/8 means 5 out of 8 equal parts

## Types of Fractions

### Proper Fractions:
Numerator < denominator (less than 1)
Examples: 1/2, 3/4, 7/10

### Improper Fractions:
Numerator ≥ denominator (equal to or greater than 1)
Examples: 5/4, 7/3, 9/9

### Mixed Numbers:
Whole number + proper fraction
Examples: 1 1/2, 2 3/4, 3 2/5

## Equivalent Fractions

Fractions that represent the same amount:
- 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8
- 2/3 = 4/6 = 6/9 = 8/12

**Finding Equivalent Fractions:**
Multiply or divide numerator and denominator by same number:
- 1/3 × 2/2 = 2/6
- 6/9 ÷ 3/3 = 2/3

## Simplifying Fractions

Reduce to lowest terms by dividing by common factors:
- 6/8 = 3/4 (divide by 2)
- 12/16 = 3/4 (divide by 4)
- 15/20 = 3/4 (divide by 5)

## Comparing Fractions

### Same Denominator:
Compare numerators: 3/7 < 5/7

### Different Denominators:
Convert to equivalent fractions with same denominator:
- Compare 2/3 and 3/4
- 2/3 = 8/12 and 3/4 = 9/12
- So 2/3 < 3/4

## Adding and Subtracting Fractions

### Same Denominator:
Add/subtract numerators, keep denominator:
- 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5
- 4/7 - 2/7 = 2/7

### Different Denominators:
Find common denominator first:
- 1/3 + 1/4 = 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

## Fractions and Decimals

### Converting Fractions to Decimals:
Divide numerator by denominator:
- 1/2 = 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5
- 3/4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75
- 1/8 = 1 ÷ 8 = 0.125

### Converting Decimals to Fractions:
- 0.5 = 5/10 = 1/2
- 0.25 = 25/100 = 1/4
- 0.75 = 75/100 = 3/4

## Practice Problems

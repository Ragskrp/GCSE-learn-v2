## Learning Objectives
- Add, subtract, multiply and divide fractions
- Convert between mixed numbers and improper fractions
- Simplify fractions to their lowest terms
- Apply fractions to real-world problems

## Key Concepts

### Adding and Subtracting Fractions
When adding or subtracting fractions, you need a common denominator:

**Example 1:** 1/3 + 1/4
- Find the lowest common multiple of 3 and 4: LCM(3,4) = 12
- Convert: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

**Example 2:** 3/5 - 1/3
- Find LCM of 5 and 3: LCM(5,3) = 15
- Convert: 9/15 - 5/15 = 4/15

### Multiplying Fractions
Multiply numerators together and denominators together:

**Example:** 2/3 × 3/4 = (2×3)/(3×4) = 6/12 = 1/2

### Dividing Fractions
Multiply by the reciprocal (flip the second fraction):

**Example:** 2/3 ÷ 3/4 = 2/3 × 4/3 = 8/9

### Mixed Numbers and Improper Fractions
**Converting to improper:** 2 3/4 = (2×4 + 3)/4 = 11/4
**Converting to mixed:** 11/4 = 2 remainder 3 = 2 3/4

## Real-World Applications
- Cooking recipes (scaling ingredients)
- Construction measurements
- Time calculations
- Financial calculations

## Practice Problems
1. Calculate: 2/5 + 1/3
2. Calculate: 3/4 × 2/9
3. Simplify: 18/24
4. Convert to mixed number: 17/5
5. A recipe calls for 2 1/3 cups of flour. If you want to make 1 1/2 times the recipe, how much flour do you need?`,

          content: `# Percentages and Percentage Change

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate percentages of amounts
- Find percentage increases and decreases
- Solve reverse percentage problems
- Apply percentages in financial contexts

## Key Concepts

### Finding a Percentage of an Amount
Method 1: Convert to decimal
15% of £240 = 0.15 × £240 = £36

Method 2: Use fractions
15% of £240 = 15/100 × £240 = £36

### Percentage Increase and Decrease
**Percentage Increase:** New Value = Original × (100 + increase%)/100
**Percentage Decrease:** New Value = Original × (100 - decrease%)/100

**Example 1:** A £200 item increases by 15%
New price = £200 × 115/100 = £200 × 1.15 = £230

**Example 2:** A £80 jacket is reduced by 25%
Sale price = £80 × 75/100 = £80 × 0.75 = £60

### Reverse Percentages
If you know the final amount after a percentage change, work backwards:

**Example:** After a 20% increase, a price is £144. Find original price.
Let original price = x
x × 1.2 = £144
x = £144 ÷ 1.2 = £120

### Compound Interest
A = P(1 + r/100)^t
Where: A = final amount, P = principal, r = rate%, t = time

**Example:** £1000 invested at 5% compound interest for 3 years
A = 1000(1.05)³ = 1000 × 1.157625 = £1157.63

## Real-World Applications
- VAT calculations (20% in UK)
- Salary increases and tax calculations
- Discount calculations in shopping
- Interest rates and investments
- Statistics and data analysis

## Practice Problems
1. Find 35% of £180
2. A £50 item is reduced by 30%. What's the new price?
3. After a 25% increase, a salary is £37,500. What was the original salary?
4. Calculate compound interest: £500 at 4% for 2 years
5. A shop adds 20% VAT to all prices. If the final price is £96, what was the pre-VAT price?`,

          content: `# Standard Form and Scientific Notation

## Learning Objectives
- Convert numbers to and from standard form
- Perform calculations with numbers in standard form
- Apply standard form to scientific contexts

## Key Concepts

Standard form expresses numbers as A × 10^n, where 1 ≤ A < 10 and n is an integer.

### Converting to Standard Form

**Large Numbers:**
345,000 = 3.45 × 10^5
(Move decimal 5 places left, so power is +5)

**Small Numbers:**
0.0078 = 7.8 × 10^-3
(Move decimal 3 places right, so power is -3)

### Converting from Standard Form
4.7 × 10^6 = 4,700,000
2.3 × 10^-4 = 0.00023

### Calculations with Standard Form

**Multiplication:**
(2.5 × 10^4) × (3 × 10^2) = (2.5 × 3) × 10^(4+2) = 7.5 × 10^6

**Division:**
(8 × 10^6) ÷ (4 × 10^3) = (8 ÷ 4) × 10^(6-3) = 2 × 10^3

**Addition/Subtraction:**
Convert to same power of 10 first:
3.2 × 10^5 + 4.7 × 10^4 = 3.2 × 10^5 + 0.47 × 10^5 = 3.67 × 10^5

## Scientific Applications
- Astronomical distances (light years, AU)
- Atomic measurements (mass, size)
- Population statistics
- Financial calculations (national debt, GDP)

## Practice Problems
1. Write 5,280,000 in standard form
2. Write 0.000091 in standard form
3. Calculate (2.5 × 10^4) × (3 × 10^2)
4. Calculate (8 × 10^6) ÷ (4 × 10^3)

## Learning Objectives
- Solve linear equations with one unknown
- Rearrange formulae to change the subject
- Solve equations with brackets and fractions
- Apply algebraic skills to real-world problems

## Key Concepts

### Basic Linear Equations
An equation where the highest power of the variable is 1.

**Example 1:** Solve 3x + 7 = 22
- Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15
- Divide by 3: x = 5
- Check: 3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22 ✓

**Example 2:** Solve 5x - 8 = 2x + 10
- Subtract 2x from both sides: 3x - 8 = 10
- Add 8 to both sides: 3x = 18
- Divide by 3: x = 6

### Equations with Brackets
Expand brackets first, then solve.

**Example:** Solve 2(x + 3) = 14
- Expand: 2x + 6 = 14
- Subtract 6: 2x = 8
- Divide by 2: x = 4

**Example:** Solve 3(2x - 1) = 4(x + 2)
- Expand: 6x - 3 = 4x + 8
- Subtract 4x: 2x - 3 = 8
- Add 3: 2x = 11
- Divide by 2: x = 5.5

### Equations with Fractions
Multiply through by the denominator to clear fractions.

**Example:** Solve (x + 2)/3 = 5
- Multiply by 3: x + 2 = 15
- Subtract 2: x = 13

**Example:** Solve x/4 + x/6 = 5
- Find common denominator (12): 3x/12 + 2x/12 = 5
- Simplify: 5x/12 = 5
- Multiply by 12: 5x = 60
- Divide by 5: x = 12

### Rearranging Formulae
Change the subject by performing inverse operations.

**Example 1:** Make x the subject of y = 3x + 2
- Subtract 2: y - 2 = 3x
- Divide by 3: x = (y - 2)/3

**Example 2:** Make r the subject of A = πr²
- Divide by π: A/π = r²
- Square root: r = √(A/π)

## Real-World Applications
- Distance, speed, time problems
- Financial calculations (loans, investments)
- Engineering and construction
- Scientific formulae

## Practice Problems
1. Solve: 5x - 3 = 17
2. Solve: 3(x - 2) = 21
3. Solve: (2x + 1)/5 = 3
4. Make t the subject: v = u + at

          content: `# Quadratic Equations

## Learning Objectives
- Solve quadratic equations by factoring
- Use the quadratic formula
- Complete the square
- Interpret solutions graphically

## Key Concepts

### Standard Form
A quadratic equation has the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0.

### Factoring Method
**Example 1:** Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0
- Factor: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
- Solutions: x = -2 or x = -3

**Example 2:** Solve x² - 7x + 12 = 0
- Factor: (x - 3)(x - 4) = 0
- Solutions: x = 3 or x = 4

### Quadratic Formula
For ax² + bx + c = 0:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

**Example:** Solve 2x² + 3x - 2 = 0
- a = 2, b = 3, c = -2
- x = (-3 ± √(9 + 16)) / 4 = (-3 ± 5) / 4
- x = 1/2 or x = -2

### Completing the Square
**Example:** Solve x² + 6x + 5 = 0
- Rearrange: x² + 6x = -5
- Complete square: (x + 3)² - 9 = -5
- Simplify: (x + 3)² = 4
- Solutions: x + 3 = ±2, so x = -1 or x = -5

### The Discriminant
b² - 4ac tells us about the nature of roots:
- If > 0: two real roots
- If = 0: one repeated root
- If < 0: no real roots

## Real-World Applications
- Projectile motion
- Area and optimization problems
- Business profit/loss calculations
- Engineering design

## Practice Problems
1. Solve by factoring: x² - 8x + 15 = 0
2. Use the quadratic formula: 3x² - 5x - 2 = 0
3. Complete the square: x² + 4x - 1 = 0

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate mean, median, mode, and range
- Interpret frequency tables and grouped data
- Create and interpret charts and graphs
- Compare data sets using statistics

## Key Concepts

### Measures of Central Tendency

**Mean (Average):**
Sum of all values ÷ number of values

Example: 2, 5, 7, 8, 3
Mean = (2 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 3) ÷ 5 = 25 ÷ 5 = 5

**Median (Middle Value):**
Arrange in order, find middle value
Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 → Median = 5

For even number of values, take mean of middle two:
2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 → Median = (5 + 7) ÷ 2 = 6

**Mode (Most Common):**
The value that appears most frequently
Example: 2, 3, 3, 5, 7 → Mode = 3

### Measures of Spread

**Range:**
Highest value - Lowest value
Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 → Range = 8 - 2 = 6

### Frequency Tables
| Score | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| 1     | 3         |
| 2     | 5         |
| 3     | 7         |
| 4     | 2         |

Mean = (1×3 + 2×5 + 3×7 + 4×2) ÷ (3+5+7+2) = 43 ÷ 17 = 2.53

### Grouped Data
For grouped data, use midpoint of each class:

| Height (cm) | Frequency | Midpoint |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| 150-159     | 5         | 154.5    |
| 160-169     | 8         | 164.5    |
| 170-179     | 3         | 174.5    |

Estimated mean = (154.5×5 + 164.5×8 + 174.5×3) ÷ 16

### Charts and Graphs
- Bar charts: for categorical data
- Histograms: for continuous data
- Pie charts: for showing proportions
- Scatter graphs: for showing correlation

## Practice Problems
1. Find mean, median, mode, and range: 4, 7, 2, 9, 5, 7, 3
2. From a frequency table showing test scores, calculate the mean
3. Interpret a histogram showing heights of students
4. Create a pie chart for favorite subjects survey data`,

          content: `# Forces and Motion

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Newton's laws of motion
- Calculate speed, velocity, and acceleration
- Analyze forces and their effects
- Apply equations of motion

## Key Concepts

### Speed, Velocity, and Acceleration

**Speed:**
- Distance traveled per unit time
- Speed = distance ÷ time
- Units: m/s, km/h
- Scalar quantity (magnitude only)

**Velocity:**
- Displacement per unit time
- Includes direction
- Vector quantity (magnitude and direction)

**Acceleration:**
- Change in velocity per unit time
- a = (v - u) ÷ t
- Units: m/s²
- Can be positive (speeding up) or negative (slowing down)

### Distance-Time Graphs
- Gradient = speed
- Horizontal line = stationary
- Curved line = changing speed

### Velocity-Time Graphs
- Gradient = acceleration
- Area under graph = displacement
- Horizontal line = constant velocity

## Newton's Laws of Motion

### First Law (Law of Inertia):
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

### Second Law:
Force = mass × acceleration
F = ma
- Force in Newtons (N)
- Mass in kilograms (kg)
- Acceleration in m/s²

### Third Law:
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Examples:
- Walking: foot pushes back on ground, ground pushes forward on foot
- Rocket propulsion: gases pushed down, rocket pushed up

## Types of Forces

### Contact Forces:
- **Friction:** opposes motion between surfaces
- **Air resistance:** friction with air
- **Normal force:** perpendicular to surface
- **Tension:** force in stretched rope/cable

### Non-contact Forces:
- **Gravitational:** attraction between masses
- **Magnetic:** attraction/repulsion between magnets
- **Electrostatic:** attraction/repulsion between charges

## Equations of Motion

For constant acceleration:
1. v = u + at
2. s = ut + ½at²
3. v² = u² + 2as

Where:
- u = initial velocity
- v = final velocity
- a = acceleration
- t = time
- s = displacement

## Weight and Mass

### Mass:
- Amount of matter in object
- Measured in kg
- Same everywhere

### Weight:
- Gravitational force on object
- Weight = mass × gravitational field strength
- W = mg (g = 9.8 N/kg on Earth)
- Measured in Newtons

## Terminal Velocity

When falling through air:
1. Initially accelerates due to gravity
2. Air resistance increases with speed
3. Eventually air resistance = weight
4. No net force, so constant velocity (terminal velocity)

## Practice Problems
1. A car travels 150m in 10s. Calculate its speed.
2. Calculate the force needed to accelerate a 1200kg car at 2m/s².
3. A ball is dropped from rest. After 3s, what is its velocity? (g = 9.8m/s²)
4. Use v² = u² + 2as to find the stopping distance of a car traveling at 20m/s with deceleration 5m/s².`,

## Learning Objectives
- Understand place value in whole numbers and decimals
- Order numbers from smallest to largest
- Round numbers to given places
- Use place value in real-world contexts

## Place Value Chart
| Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Units | . | Tenths | Hundredths | Thousandths |
|-----------|----------|------|-------|---|--------|------------|-------------|
|     3     |    4     |  2   |   7   | . |   5    |     8      |      6      |

The number above is: 3,427.586
- 3 is worth 3,000 (3 thousands)
- 4 is worth 400 (4 hundreds)
- 2 is worth 20 (2 tens)
- 7 is worth 7 (7 units)
- 5 is worth 0.5 (5 tenths)
- 8 is worth 0.08 (8 hundredths)
- 6 is worth 0.006 (6 thousandths)

## Ordering Numbers
To order numbers from smallest to largest:
1. Compare the largest place value first
2. If equal, move to the next place value
3. Continue until you find a difference

**Example:** Order: 3.45, 3.4, 3.54, 3.405
- All have 3 units
- Compare tenths: 4, 4, 5, 4
- 3.54 is largest (5 tenths)
- Compare hundredths of remaining: 5, 0, 0.5
- Order: 3.4, 3.405, 3.45, 3.54

## Rounding Numbers
**Rules for Rounding:**
- Look at the digit to the right of the rounding place
- If 5 or more, round up
- If less than 5, round down

**Examples:**
- Round 3.47 to 1 decimal place: Look at 7 (≥5), so 3.5
- Round 2,847 to nearest 100: Look at 4 (<5), so 2,800
- Round 156.83 to nearest whole number: Look at 8 (≥5), so 157

## Real-World Applications
- Money: £3.47 rounded to nearest penny
- Measurements: 2.34m rounded to nearest cm
- Population: 45,678 people rounded to nearest thousand

## Practice Problems
1. What is the value of 7 in 2,374.56?
2. Order these numbers: 4.2, 4.02, 4.12, 4.021
3. Round 67.89 to 1 decimal place
4. Round 3,456 to the nearest hundred
5. A shop sells items for £2.47, £3.89, and £1.23. Order from cheapest to most expensive.`,

          content: `# Understanding Fractions

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what fractions represent
- Compare and order fractions
- Add and subtract simple fractions
- Convert between fractions and decimals

## What are Fractions?

A fraction represents part of a whole:
- **Numerator** (top number): how many parts we have
- **Denominator** (bottom number): how many equal parts in total

Examples:
- 3/4 means 3 out of 4 equal parts
- 1/2 means 1 out of 2 equal parts (half)
- 5/8 means 5 out of 8 equal parts

## Types of Fractions

### Proper Fractions:
Numerator < denominator (less than 1)
Examples: 1/2, 3/4, 7/10

### Improper Fractions:
Numerator ≥ denominator (equal to or greater than 1)
Examples: 5/4, 7/3, 9/9

### Mixed Numbers:
Whole number + proper fraction
Examples: 1 1/2, 2 3/4, 3 2/5

## Equivalent Fractions

Fractions that represent the same amount:
- 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8
- 2/3 = 4/6 = 6/9 = 8/12

**Finding Equivalent Fractions:**
Multiply or divide numerator and denominator by same number:
- 1/3 × 2/2 = 2/6
- 6/9 ÷ 3/3 = 2/3

## Simplifying Fractions

Reduce to lowest terms by dividing by common factors:
- 6/8 = 3/4 (divide by 2)
- 12/16 = 3/4 (divide by 4)
- 15/20 = 3/4 (divide by 5)

## Comparing Fractions

### Same Denominator:
Compare numerators: 3/7 < 5/7

### Different Denominators:
Convert to equivalent fractions with same denominator:
- Compare 2/3 and 3/4
- 2/3 = 8/12 and 3/4 = 9/12
- So 2/3 < 3/4

## Adding and Subtracting Fractions

### Same Denominator:
Add/subtract numerators, keep denominator:
- 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5
- 4/7 - 2/7 = 2/7

### Different Denominators:
Find common denominator first:
- 1/3 + 1/4 = 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

## Fractions and Decimals

### Converting Fractions to Decimals:
Divide numerator by denominator:
- 1/2 = 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5
- 3/4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75
- 1/8 = 1 ÷ 8 = 0.125

### Converting Decimals to Fractions:
- 0.5 = 5/10 = 1/2
- 0.25 = 25/100 = 1/4
- 0.75 = 75/100 = 3/4

## Practice Problems
1. Which is larger: 2/3 or 3/5?
2. Simplify: 12/18
3. Calculate: 1/4 + 1/3
4. Convert to decimal: 3/8
5. Convert to fraction: 0.6`,
